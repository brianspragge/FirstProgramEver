My Story:
This was at the very beginning of my journey to code.  I tried coding when I was about 10.
My older brother showed me a program called Alice.  I spent a few days on it. I  was about
22 and tried coding again, with Java.  That was when Ai started to get popular but before
the really big boom with Chatgpt, then Grok, then Claude.  Years before those got a ton of
traction.  I absolutely failed with Java, and really didn't like it.  Years later, when I
was 27, I got really sick and had to stay home from work for about a year.  I picked up a
book called Python Crash Course 3rd Edition, and went through the entire thing in a couple
months.  I loved it.  I couldn't even play video games, it was so engaging.  I created
websites, games, graphs, all of it and more.  It was while I was going through the book
that I was having trouble remembering which built-in Python functions did what, and so
decided to make my own program to help me.  This is that program.  I never really finished
it, but it helped a lot.

SO, I started learning in August of 2024, and it is currently April 3rd of 2025.  I am
creating a file organizing app, and studying a book called Data Structures & Algorithms in
Python.  It is very good, but I am having to relearn old algebra in order to finish it.
That's it for that.  I just wanted to make sure I journaled the beginning of what is
hopefully a new career.  Thanks for reading, and keep your head low, and your eyes high.
